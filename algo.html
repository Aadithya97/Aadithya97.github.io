            <span><u>Gossip Simulator in a Distributed System using Erlang - October 2022</u></span><br>
            Technology/Languages: Erlang, Distributed Systems, Gossip Protocols, Networking<br>
            Optimized group communication system performance by writing a tool that compared convergence time for 10,000 nodes using both Gossip and push-sum algorithms, resulting in improved efficiency.<br><br>
          
            <span><u>Bitcoin Mining Simulator using Erlang - October 2022</u></span><br>
            Technology/Languages: Erlang, Actor Model, Hashing<br>
            Designed a highly efficient bitcoin mining simulator using Erlang that successfully mined bitcoins by running SHA 256 hash on random strings and calculating the leading zeroes with precision.<br><br>
          
            <span><u>Greedy Algorithm based solution to optimize number of tasks that can be performed by a single resource - February 2023</u></span><br>
            Technology/Languages: Algorithm Analysis, Python, Greedy Algorithms<br>
            Provided a solution to find the maximum number of houses that could be painted by a team of painters across a certain number of days subject to a set of constraints. This optimized solution was tested for up to 6000 houses.<br><br>
          
            <span><u>Dynamic Programming approach to find the largest grid of planted trees across a state's districts for resident zone planning - February 2023</u></span><br>
            Technology/Languages: Algorithm Analysis, Python, Dynamic Programming, Metrics visualization<br>
            Wrote a highly efficient dynamic programming solution to find the largest grid of trees that satisfied certain constraints in order to allocate locations for planning residential zones in a state. The python code took as input the grid representing the districts of the state and a constraint that specified the number of trees required in each district, and returned the largest suitable grid as an output.<br><br>
          
            <span><u>Twitter Clone using Erlang and Distributed Systems - Oct 2022</u></span><br>
            Technology/Languages: Erlang, Distributed Systems, Actor Model, Networking, HTML, CSS<br>
            Built a twitter clone where users could register, login, create and share tweets using a web client that communicate with a server that ran on a distributed computing system to increase the efficiency.
